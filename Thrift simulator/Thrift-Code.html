          <h3 style="text-align: center;">What problem does Thrift simulator solve?</h3>
      
          
            <p>As we go into 2025, we can see an increase in people playing video games and going thrifting. However with the increased use of tik tok and short form content, more and more people's attention spans arwe getting smaller and smaller.
          Thirfting has also been on the rise in recent years. I've noticed that it has become less of healthy environmental positive and affordable  shopping hobby and become more of a compettive and expensive hobby. With Thrift Simulator, i am aiming to bring this expensive hobby to 
          the homes of gamers and thrifters across the world. I want to make a fun interactive thrifting game that will promote running a business and enjoying the hobby of thrifting for an affordable price. Alot of thrifters are younger and use their parents money or have to do extra work 
          to make a couple bucks to pursue their thrifting passion but with this game, we will make this hobby more affordable while keeping or customers engaged. Thrift simulator is also a completeley unique experience. most simulator games on steam have their own niche but none of them are
          about thrifting.</p>
          <p> Some key features that thrift simulator will have are price comparisons, thrift shopping itself, tagging and hanging items to sell in your store, researching aquired items and seling them for a price of your choice.</p>

        <div class="w3-justify">
          <h3 style="text-align: center;"> What will our business model look like? How will we aquire and retain customers?</h3>
          <p>We plan to haver a simple game business model. We want to have an affordable game priced at only 16$. We chose to go with this low price to promote an affordable experience. Not only will it be 16$ we also want 
            to have frequent sales that bring the game down to around 9$. this will help people who already have the game spread the word to their online friends that the game is on sale, which is more exposure. We want the game to have an early access
          which  will let early funders and supporters get a feel for the gameplay. i like this idea because it also lets us get feed back on game mechanics and changes we can make before our full launch. along with game purchases and early access, 
          we will add downloadable content (DLC) which will bring new stores, clothes and features that our customers can pay for to experience. the DLCs will come post launch but it will also keep the game fresh to existing players. 
          some ways we will  market the game are going to be short ads on youtube and small pop ups on gaming agn thrifting websites. we also want to run bundle sales with other simulator games to get our name out there. one of our goals on early access
          launch and full game launch is to be on the front page of steam sos that people can see that we are a new game and not have to do so much digging through steam. i know that one of the best ways to keep your players engaged ion your game is to keep 
          it feeling fresh. along with our DlCs we will release updates often to clear bugs and add small features to gameoplay and quality of life.

          <p><h3 style="text-align: center;"> Who is our target audience? How will we reach them? Who is our competition and how will we beat them?</h3></p>
          <p>Thrift simulators target audience will be people 15 to 29. we choose thuis audience because that the age range of people who go thrift shopping aand play video games. another taget audience is people who are passionate about fashion and are interested 
            in running a business. we know our game wioll do well beacause dress up games made upwards of 7 billion$ in 2023. our game will meet our customer needs by providing them will an affordable way to thrift shop whikle also run a business. i beleive this will be one 
            of our games biggest attractions beacause it will be inclusive. letting someone who isnt as financially stable still pursue thier passion while also enjoying themselves. However our game will not come without competion. we will have some big competition going into 
            steam with other simulators like TCG card shop simulator, farming simulator, trucking simulator and flying simulator. al these simulators are very popular but thety are also for a specific niche. Our simulator will 
            have an edge over those because we also have a nice but our niche is alot more broad becasue everyone knows about shopping but it will also give you additional knowledge in strategic business management. we also plan on being
            a smaller game, not like a tripple A title but more of an smaller game that might gain its onw traction through word of mouth.

          <p><h3 style="text-align: center;"> What do we need to make the game? Who can we talk to about thrifting and running a business? How much will it cost ofr a year of production on the game?</h3></p>
          <p> To get our game into production we will need a good amout of resources. For starters we will need an office that can hold all of our team members and provide a safe space for us to work ans focus in peace. we also will need 
            a team to fill that office. Some positions that are needed to build the game are concept artists (draft and visualize layouts, models and other visual aspects of the game), coders (put the actual code into the game to 
            allow funtions to happen) and 3D modelers (use concept art to create models to use in the game). all of these roles will be key to makeing the came actually come to life. Some other roles that we will need for the game to play properly 
            are gonna be people who have knowledge in running a full store so we can get information from them and also people who take thrifting very seriously so we can understand the process and the effort that really goes into it. hopefully we 
            would be able to aquire some of this knowledge from them for free but if not we can also pay them for the information. finally one of our last positions will be some one to do research on everything else that we need like itmes to sell, 
            accurate data and proper practices inside of the game. To do all of this we humbly ask for 100,000$ for the first year of production. this will cover costs of wages, software and hardware, office space and information from external sources.
